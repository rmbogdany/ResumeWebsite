			I am computer science major in my third year. I wanted to learn how to program because I love problem-solving and programming is a practical way to solve many problems in the real world. 
			Since coming to college programming has become a passion of mine. I enjoy teaching myself different languages and then seeing how they can apply to a certain problem. 
			Ever since I was little I have been curious about everything, I was the child that constantly annoyed my parents with questions about random topics. Computer science has even more increased 
			my curiosity and my desire for knowledge because there are so many things I don't know or haven't even been exposed to yet. 
			</p>

			I have a passion for helping others, from very early on in my life I have gotten involved with my community. Starting in elementary school I was volunteering through
			my church and when I got to high school I joined key club. Through this I volunteered for many different organizations and events such as March of Dimes and Ronald McDonald House of Charity.
			Similarly I have continued to volunteer in college through my sorority. We volunteer at Autism Speaks walks and a local Rochester organization Autism Up, where we help teach
			children with special needs basketball.
			</p>

			I, also, enjoy helping teach others. In high school, I worked with my 4-H club and taught younger kids how to sew and knit. Now in college I have started working as an Student Lab Instructor,
			where I am in beginner computer science class working with students to help them with their labs and to understand the basics of programming. Additionally I work in the mentoring lab in my 
			department, where I am available to help students from many different classes and years. This experience not only has been one of my favorite parts of college because I have been able to
			see how appreciative students are when I am to sit down and help them work through a problem they are struggling with, but it has also been extremely valuable in growing my communication skills
			as I have to be professional with professors and my coworkers but I also have grown in my ability to breakdown a problem and explain it to someone else.
