			<p>
			DanceParty (personal project) – a game created in Java Swing. The goal of this game was to be a simple concept to help teach children how to program. It uses interactive buttons to allow the user traverse through the game. Each step of the game explains simple programming concepts, prompting the user to choose what their code will look like. It outputs their choice and demonstrates how the code works.
			<br/>
			Crossing (class project) – a strategic game in JavaFx. Created a backend storage using 2-D arrays to create the game board and represent the moves made, objective was to create a fully connected line from one end to the other of the game board without being blocked by the opponent. Used Dijkstra’s algorithm to create a strategy for placing optimal moves, including moves to block opponent and advance your own position. Beat majority of other students algorithms and implementations during a class competition.
