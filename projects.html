			<h1>
			Bubbles
			</h1>
			<p>
			I have developed a bubbles game, the goal is to keep getting bigger and growing by overtaking bubbles smaller than you. But if one that is bigger over takes you then you lose.
			This is still in development I would like to add more colors and change the circles to fish.
			</p>
			<p>
			This game was developed using html, css, and javascript.
